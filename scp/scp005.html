            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>SCP-005 poses <span class="red">no immediate risk</span> in any direct sense. Even so, its unique
                functions require special measures be
                taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel
                is
                required for the removal of the object from its containment area.</p>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced
                key
                used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security
                facility.
                SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they
                mechanical
                or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.</p>

            <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
            <p>SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only under the supervision of at least
                one
                (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for any
                personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will result in immediate
                termination.</p>

            <h3>Appendix A:</h3>
            <p>While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further
                experiments
                have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat
                successful
                in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify
                a
                locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results,
                SCP-005 has
                been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive
                abilities.
                However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any
                particular
                locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.</p>

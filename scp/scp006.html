            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is
                necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following procedures
                are
                required not for personnel safety, but to <span class="red">deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's
                    effects</span> from the personnel who
                interact with it.</p>

            <h3>Additional note:</h3>
            <p>- All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC
                suits.
                Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or
                SCP-006C.
                SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure
                personnel are
                wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a
                leak in
                the suit.</p>

            <p>- Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with
                SCP-006, the
                commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe
                to mean
                high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.
            </p>

            <p>- Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level
                personnel. The
                liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.
                -If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined
                and
                terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective
                termination
                method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)</p>

            <h3>Description:</h3>

            <p>SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its
                existence
                since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of
                the
                spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under
                Foundation
                and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple
                mineral
                water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".</p>

            <p>Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA
                damaged by
                sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the
                repair
                of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon
                testing the
                liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles
                and birds
                were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits as humans.</p>

            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>SCP-002 is to <span class="red">remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times</span>, to keep
                it in what appears to be a
                recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility
                is to
                be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of
                X-ray
                and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned
                to
                recharging mode. <span class="red">Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all
                    times.</span></p>

            <p>Teams including a <span class="red">minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters</span> of
                SCP-002 or its containment area.
                Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another
                person
                present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object.</p>

            <p>No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written
                authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must be
                escorted
                by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and must temporarily
                surrender
                their rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5 km from
                SCP-002
                to <span class="red">undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation</span>. If
                deemed fit for return to duty by
                psych staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine expires.</p>

            <h3>Description:</h3>

            <p>SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve
                hatch on
                one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One
                wall of
                the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room
                contains
                furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other
                biological
                substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA
                sequences
                for each object in the room.

                Refer to the Mulhausen Report [cross-ref:document00.023.603] for details related to object's discovery.
            </p>

            <h3>Reference:</h3>

            <p>To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its time
                at the
                facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag chair,
                three
                books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of
                lab
                animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to
                produce
                any effect. Whatever process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently
                only
                facilitated by the introduction of living humans.</p>
            <br>

            <span class="blue">Mulhausen Report docid:00.023.603</span></p>

            <p>The following is a brief report detailing the discovery of SCP-002</p>

            <p>Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where it struck the Earth from orbit.
                Encased in a
                shell of thick rock, the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact. A native farmer
                happened upon
                the site and reported his findings to the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4
                agent
                posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly generated by the object.</p>

            <p>A collection squad of SCP security personnel led by General Mulhausen was immediately dispatched to the
                area
                where they quickly secured the subject in a large container and performed initial testing with subjects
                recruited from the nearby village. Three men individually sent into the structure subsequently
                disappeared. Upon
                discovering this deadly property of the subject, General Mulhausen issued a Level 4a Termination Order
                of any
                witnesses (roughly 1/3 of the village) to ensure no outside knowledge of the object and initiated its
                transport
                to SCP facility <span class="expunge">[DATA EXPUNGED]</span>.</p>

            <p>During preparation for transport, four SCP security personnel were inexplicably drawn inside the object
                where
                they too immediately disappeared. Following inspection, it appeared as if the object had "grown" several
                new
                furnishings and was beginning to look like the interior of an apartment room. General Mulhausen
                immediately
                ordered the requisition of several Class III HAZMAT suits for the remaining security team members, who
                proceeded
                to lift the container onto a waiting freight ship for transport to the SCP containment facility.</p>

            <p><span class="expunge">[DATA EXPUNGED]</span></p>

            <p><span class="expunge">[DATA EXPUNGED]</span></p>

            <p>the termination of General Mulhausen, SCP-002 was re-secured by SCP staff and brought into special
                containment in <span class="expunge">[CLASSIFIED]</span>, where it currently resides. Staff with
                clearance below Level 3 have been denied
                access to the SCP-002 container without prior approval of at least two Level 4 staff after the Mulhausen
                incident.</p>
